"Which countries and international organizations have imposed sanctions against Russia and Crimea, and what were the reasons for these sanctions?","A large number of countries, including the United States, Canada, the European Union, and international organizations, have imposed sanctions against Russia and Crimea. These sanctions were imposed following the Russian annexation of Crimea, which began in late February 2014. The sanctions were imposed against individuals, businesses, and officials from Russia and Ukraine. The United States enacted the Magnitsky Act in 2012 to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, and later passed the Global Magnitsky Act to allow sanctions on foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses. The European Union and other countries also passed similar laws to ban foreigners involved in human rights abuses from entering their countries. The sanctions were aimed at bringing about a change in policy or activity by Russia and Crimea.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The company is still in the process of deciding what to do.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What will the company do?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The company has decided to expand its operations in Asia.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What will the company do with its operations?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n\n        from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n        from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n        from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n        import nltk\n        nltk.download('punkt')\n        nltk.download('wordnet')\n        nltk.download('stopwords')\n\n        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n        stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\n        def tokenize_and_lemmatize(text):\n            tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())\n            tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stop_words]\n            tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(t) for t in tokens]\n            return''.join(tokens)\n\n"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n    \""\""\""\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    answer = answer.lower().replace('.', '').replace(',', '').replace('?', '').replace('!', '').replace(';', '').replace(':', '')\n    \n    # Remove stopwords\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    words = [word for word in answer.split() if word not in stop_words]\n    \n    # Identify the most common words\n    word_freq = collections.Counter(words)\n    common_words = [word for word, freq in word_freq.most_common(5)]\n    \n    # Generate a question\n    if'sanctions' in common_words:\n        question = \""What are the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?\""\n    elif 'russia' in common_words:\n        question = \""What is happening in Russia?\""\n    elif 'crimea' in common_words:\n        question = \""What is happening in Crimea?\""\n    else:\n        question = \""What is the current situation?\""\n    \n    # Determine if the answer is noncommittal\n    if'might' in answer or 'can't' in answer or 'guarantee' in answer"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        I'm not sure, we'll have to check the manual.\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the solution to this problem?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer: The new policy has been met with widespread criticism and resistance from various groups, including environmental organizations, indigenous peoples, and local communities.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the reaction to the new policy?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: I'm not sure, we'll have to look it up.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer to this question?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The company has been accused of several controversies, including environmental damage, labor rights violations, and financial irregularities.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the controversies surrounding the company?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: I think it's a good idea, but we need to discuss it further""]","["""", ""What are the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?"", """"]","[1, 0, 1]",0,"[""parse_failed"", ""ok"", ""parse_failed""]",1

"What caused the crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in Pokhara, Nepal?","The crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in Pokhara, Nepal was caused by a technical issue with the plane. According to a spokesperson from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the weather was clear at the time of the crash, and preliminary information suggests that the crash was due to a technical problem. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders were recovered and examined, and a preliminary report indicated that the propellers of the aircraft had been feathered, causing the engines to produce no thrust and leading the plane into a stall. It was also noted that the power levers and condition levers were incorrectly set, possibly due to a mistake during the landing checklist.

What are the main science objectives of the JUICE orbiter and what moons will it study?,"The main science objectives of the JUICE orbiter are to perform detailed investigations on Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto, three of Jupiter's Galilean moons. For Ganymede, the objectives include characterizing the ocean layers and detecting subsurface water reservoirs, mapping the surface topography, geology, and composition, studying the physical properties of the icy crusts, characterizing the internal mass distribution and dynamics of the interior, investigating Ganymede's tenuous atmosphere, and studying its intrinsic magnetic field and its interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere. For Europa, the focus is on studying the chemistry essential to life, including organic molecules, understanding the formation of surface features, and determining the composition of non-water-ice material. The JUICE orbiter will also carry out spatially resolved observations of several minor irregular satellites and the volcanically active moon Io.",,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the main science objectives of the JUICE orbiter?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        The JUICE orbiter will study the Jupiter's Galilean moons, including Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto.\n\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What will the JUICE orbiter study?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        It depends on the context.\n\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer to [insert context]?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        The JUICE orbiter will study the Jupiter's Galilean moons, including Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto.

What is the objective of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project and how is it expected to enhance trade and logistics efficiency?,"The objective of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project is to create a direct railway link between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, passing through Afghanistan's territory. This project aims to enhance trade and logistics efficiency by establishing a 573-km rail connection that would connect Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to Kabul and Peshawar, the capitals of Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively. The implementation of this project is anticipated to strengthen trade relations between Pakistan and South Asia. The trilateral agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan aims to significantly reduce cargo delivery times between Uzbekistan and Pakistan by approximately five days. The railway route will traverse through Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Logar in Afghanistan, and continue to the Kharlachi border crossing in Pakistan's northwestern Kurram district. This railway is designed to facilitate both passenger and freight services, fostering regional trade and contributing to overall economic growth in the area.",,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the objective of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n        # Preprocess the answer\n        answer = self.preprocess_answer(answer)\n\n        # Identify the question\n        question = self.generate_question(answer)\n\n        # Determine if the answer is noncommittal\n        noncommittal = self.is_noncommittal(answer)\n\n        # Return the output\n        return {\""question\"": question, \""noncommittal\"": noncommittal}\n\n    def preprocess_answer(self, answer):\n        # Remove punctuation\n        answer = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', answer)\n\n        # Convert to lowercase\n        answer = answer.lower()\n\n        # Tokenize the answer\n        answer = nltk.word_tokenize(answer)\n\n        return answer\n\n    def generate_question(self, answer):\n        # Identify the main topic of the answer\n        topic = self.identify_topic(answer)\n\n        # Generate a question based on the topic\n        if topic == \""definition\"":\n            question = \""What is the definition of {}?\""\n        elif topic == \""purpose\"":\n            question = \""What is the purpose of {}?\""\n        elif topic == \""description\"":\n            question = \""What"", "" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the objective of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The company's vision is to be a leading provider of innovative and sustainable solutions, creating a better future for our customers, employees, and the communities we serve.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the company's vision?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        We will continue to monitor the situation and adjust our strategy accordingly.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What will you do about the situation?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The company's mission is to empower its customers to achieve their goals by providing them with the right tools, resources, and expertise.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the company's mission?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        We are still in the process of evaluating the proposal.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the status of the proposal?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The purpose of this"", "" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the purpose of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project is expected to reduce cargo delivery times between Uzbekistan and Pakistan by approximately five days.\n\n        Output: \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How will the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project impact cargo delivery times?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project aims to strengthen trade relations between Pakistan and South Asia.\n\n        Output: \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How will the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project affect trade relations?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project will traverse through Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, and Logar in Afghanistan, and continue to the Kharlachi border crossing in Pakistan's northwestern Kurram district.\n\n        Output: \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Where will the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project pass through?\"",\n        \""non""]","["""", """", """"]","[1, 1, 1]",0,"[""parse_failed"", ""parse_failed"", ""parse_failed""]",1

What factors contributed to the Sri Lankan economic crisis?,"The Sri Lankan economic crisis was caused by multiple compounding factors. These include tax cuts and money creation by the government, which led to budget deficits and a decline in government revenue. The government's decision to shift to organic or biological farming also played a role. Additionally, the crisis was exacerbated by the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's high external debt, with a significant increase in foreign debt in recent years, also contributed to the crisis.

When was GPT-4 released and what are some of its capabilities?,"GPT-4 was released on March 14, 2023. It is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI and is the fourth model in the GPT series. Some of its capabilities include being able to take images as well as text as input, having context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, and being able to perform tasks beyond text-prediction such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages. GPT-4 also demonstrates aptitude on standardized tests and has been tested in medical applications.

"What caused the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023, and what were the consequences of the violence?","The ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023 was sparked by tensions between the Meitei people, who reside in the Imphal Valley, and the Kuki tribal community from the surrounding hills. The violence erupted after a High Court ordered that the Meitei community be recommended for Scheduled Tribe status, which caused protests and clashes between the two groups. The violence resulted in the deaths of 142 people, with over 300 wounded and approximately 54,488 people displaced. Houses, places of worship, and other properties were burnt and destroyed during the riots. The violence also deepened existing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities, with inflammatory statements made by political leaders further exacerbating the situation. A panel led by a retired Chief Justice was established to investigate the violence, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe six cases related to conspiracy in the violence.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What caused the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n        import nltk\n        from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n        from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n        import re\n        import string\n        import numpy as np\n        from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n        from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\n\n        nltk.download('punkt')\n        nltk.download('stopwords')\n\n        stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\n        # Preprocessing\n        answer = re.sub(r'\\d+', '', answer)\n        answer = answer.translate(str.maketrans('', '', string.punctuation))\n        answer = answer.lower()\n        tokens = word_tokenize(answer)\n        tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stop_words]\n\n        # TF-IDF vectorization\n        vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n        tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform([answer])\n\n        # Create a dictionary of questions\n        questions = {\n            'what': ['what', 'which', 'who', 'whom', 'whose'],\n            'where': ['where', 'whence', 'whither'],\n            'when': ['when',"", "" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What triggered the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The company is still exploring its options for the future.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the company's plans for the future?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n    \""\""\""\n    import re\n    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n    from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n    import string\n    from collections import Counter\n    import nltk\n    nltk.download('wordnet')\n    nltk.download('stopwords')\n    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    punctuation = set(string.punctuation)\n\n    answer = re.sub(r'\\W+','', answer).lower()\n    tokens = word_tokenize(answer)\n    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens if token not in stop_words and token not in punctuation]\n    counter = Counter(tokens)\n\n    # Identify the most common words in the answer\n    common_words = [word for word, count in counter.most_common("", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What was the cause of the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n\n        # Preprocess the answer by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation\n        answer = answer.lower()\n        answer = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', answer)\n\n        # Tokenize the answer into individual words or phrases\n        tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(answer)\n\n        # Identify the main entities and relationships in the answer\n        entities = []\n        relationships = []\n        for token in tokens:\n            if token in nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'):\n                continue\n            if token.isalpha():\n                entities.append(token)\n            elif token.startswith('the'):\n                entities.append(token)\n            elif token.startswith('a'):\n                entities.append(token)\n            elif token.startswith('an'):\n                entities.append(token)\n            else:\n                relationships.append(token)\n\n        # Generate a question based on the entities and relationships\n        question = ''\n        for entity in entities:\n            if entity.isalpha():\n                question += 'What is the'+ entity + '?'\n            else:\n                question += entity\n        for relationship in relationships:\n            question +='' + relationship\n\n        # Classify""]","[""What caused the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023?"", """", ""What was the cause of the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023?""]","[0, 1, 0]",0,"[""ok"", ""parse_failed"", ""ok""]",1

"What is the current status of the Myanmar civil war, and how many people have been internally displaced since the coup?","The current status of the Myanmar civil war is complex and evolving. Since the military coup in February 2021, there has been widespread unrest and resistance from the civilian population. Armed ethnic groups have also been involved in clashes with the military forces. However, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the situation due to limited access to information and ongoing conflicts.\n\nRegarding the number of internally displaced people since the coup, it is difficult to provide an exact figure.

"How many teams participate in the Turkish Women's Football Super League, and what is the format of the league?","In the 2022–23 season, the Turkish Women's Football Super League consists of one group of 10 teams and one group of nine teams. The teams play a double round robin and finals to determine the champion club, which qualifies for the UEFA Women's Champions League. The league format has undergone changes over the years, with different numbers of teams and various rounds of play. In the 2010–11 season, there were twelve teams and a championship and relegation group. In the 2012–13 season, there were ten teams and a double-round robin format. In the 2019-20 season, the league expanded to twelve teams again, and no relegation took place. The 2020-21 season was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and featured 16 teams divided into four groups. Each team played three matches in a round-robin tournament, and the top two teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals and semi-finals in a single-elimination tournament.

How does the height and thrust of the Starship rocket compare to other rockets?,"The Starship rocket has a height of 120 meters (394 feet), making it the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. It surpasses the thrust of NASA's Space Launch System, Saturn V, and the Soviet N1, which previously held the record. The Starship rocket has a liftoff mass of 5,000 metric tons (11,000,000 pounds) and is powered by Raptor rocket engines, which burn liquid methane and liquid oxygen. It operates in a full-flow staged combustion power cycle. The rocket is designed to be fully reusable, with both the first-stage Super Heavy booster and the second-stage spacecraft, also named Starship, performing controlled landings. The Starship rocket has a payload capacity of 150 tonnes (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in a fully reusable configuration and 250 t (550,000 lb) when expended. It is also designed to enable transit to higher energy destinations such as geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars by refilling with propellant launched in tanker Starships. The Starship rocket represents SpaceX's ambition to become its primary launch vehicle, superseding the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles. It is a key component of SpaceX's plans for Mars exploration and settlement, as well as other missions such as the Starlink internet constellation and crewed lunar landings under the Artemis program.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the specifications of the Starship rocket?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Note: You can use NLTK, spaCy, or Stanford CoreNLP for natural language processing.

"What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?","On Venus, there are shield volcanoes, pancake dome volcanoes, and scalloped margin domes. Shield volcanoes on Venus can cover hundreds of kilometers in area and have an average height of 1.5 kilometers. They cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward and can produce flexural moats and ring fractures. Pancake dome volcanoes on Venus are up to 15 kilometers in diameter and less than 1 kilometer in height. They are associated with coronae and tesserae and are formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Scalloped margin domes, also known as ""tick-like"" structures, have numerous legs and have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. These types of volcanoes are not present on Earth. On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. Shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii, eject relatively fluid magma from hot spots, while composite volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates and erupt gummier lava.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the different types of volcanoes found on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n    \""\""\""\n\nimport re\n\ndef generate_question(answer):\n    answer = answer.lower()\n    question = \""\""\n    noncommittal = 0\n\n    # Check for noncommittal phrases\n    noncommittal_phrases = [\""might\"", \""can't\"", \""may\"", \""might not\"", \""could\"", \""could not\"", \""perhaps\"", \""possibly\"", \""maybe\"", \""potentially\"", \""it depends\"", \""it depends on\"", \""it depends on that\"", \""that depends\"", \""that depends on\"", \""that depends on that\"", \""it is possible\"", \""it is possible that\"", \""it is possible that it\"", \""it is possible that it is\"", \""it is possible that it is that\"", \""it is possible that it is that it\"", \""it is possible that it is that it is\"", \""it is possible that it is that it is that\"", \""it is possible that it is that it is that it\"", \""it is possible that it is that it is that it is\"", \""it is possible that it is that it is that it is that\"", \""it is possible that it is"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the different types of volcanoes on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The data shows a decline in the number of people who own a home.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the trend in home ownership?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        It depends on the specific context and the level of involvement.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How does one's level of involvement affect [something]?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \""\""\""\nimport re\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nimport string\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\ndef process_text(text):\n    text = text.lower()\n    text = re.sub(r'\\d+', '', text)\n    text = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', text)\n    tokens = word_tokenize(text)\n    tokens = [t for t in tokens"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the different types of volcanoes found on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        It's a complex issue and there are many factors to consider.\n\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What should we do about this issue?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The best way to get there is by taking a taxi or an Uber.\n\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How do I get to [destination]?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        It's a tough one, but I think we can figure it out.\n\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How do we solve this problem?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The answer is 42.\n\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        It's a difficult question, but I think it's worth exploring.\n\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the best approach""]","[""What are the different types of volcanoes found on Venus?"", """", """"]","[0, 1, 1]",0,"[""ok"", ""parse_failed"", ""parse_failed""]",1

What is the Zubaydah Trail and when was it constructed?,"The Zubaydah Trail, also known as the Al-Kufi pilgrimage route, is one of the seven major pilgrimage routes in the Arabian Peninsula. It dates back over 1000 years and was constructed during the Abbasid Caliphate, specifically between 132 AH (750 CE) and 656 AH (1258 CE). The trail served as a crucial trade route during the Abbasid era and was designed to serve pilgrims from Iraq, neighboring Islamic countries, and East Asian countries. It stretches over a distance of 1,300 kilometers and is connected to 27 main stations, with 58 subsidiary stations called Muta'asha established between them. Queen Zubaydah, the daughter of Caliph Abu Ja'far al-Mansur and wife of Caliph Harun al-Rashid, played a significant role in the development of the trail and it was named after her.",,"["" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the Zubaydah Trail?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The trail has been used for centuries and is still used today.\n        Output: \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How long has the Zubaydah Trail been used?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: It's difficult to say.\n        Output: \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How long has the Zubaydah Trail been used?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The Zubaydah Trail is a 1,300 km route that has been used for centuries.\n        Output: \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How long is the Zubaydah Trail?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The Zubaydah Trail is a significant route that has been used for centuries.\n        Output: \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What significance does the Zubaydah Trail have?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The Zubaydah Trail is a significant route that has been used for centuries, and it's a great route.\n        Output"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the Zubaydah Trail?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        I'm not sure, I'd have to look it up.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the Zubaydah Trail?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }       \n\n\n        \""\""\""\n\n        # Split the answer into words\n        words = answer.split()\n\n        # Check if the answer starts with a negation word\n        if words[0].lower() in ['i', 'it', 'they', 'we', 'you', 'he','she', 'it']:\n            # If it starts with a negation word, it's likely noncommittal\n            noncommittal = 1\n        elif words[0].lower() in ['the', 'a', 'an']:\n            # If it starts with an article, it's likely a specific answer\n            noncommittal = 0\n        else:\n            # If it doesn't start with a negation or article, it's likely noncommittal\n            noncommittal = 1\n\n        # Check if the answer contains vague words\n        vague_words = ['might', 'could"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the Zubaydah Trail?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }  \n\n        Answer: \n        It is a bit of a stretch, but I think we can make it work.  \n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Can we make it work?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }  \n\n        Answer: \n        The main difference between a car and a motorcycle is that a car has four wheels, while a motorcycle has two wheels.  \n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the main difference between a car and a motorcycle?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }  \n\n        Answer: \n        It's possible that we could find a way to make it work, but we would need to look into it further.  \n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Can we make it work?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }  \n\n        Answer: \n        I don't know if it will work or not.  \n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Will it work?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }  \n\n        Answer: \n        The main reason""]","["""", """", """"]","[1, 1, 1]",0,"[""parse_failed"", ""parse_failed"", ""parse_failed""]",1

Currently, patients with OUD can only access methadone at methadone clinics, and pharmacies are prohibited from dispensing the medication. This proposed legislation would give pharmacies the ability to provide methadone to patients with OUD, and it would also allow approved healthcare providers to prescribe take-home doses for OUD patients.

"Who is buried in the Tomb of Alexander Stewart, and what is the condition of the tomb?","The Tomb of Alexander Stewart, also known as the Tomb of the Wolf of Badenoch, was built for Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, who is buried underneath. The tomb consists of a 15th-century tomb effigy and altar tomb, both carved from marble. The effigy shows Stuart in full knightly armor, with a lion or dog resting at his feet.

What is the human climate niche and how is it estimated?,"The human climate niche refers to the range of climate conditions that have supported human life and activities, such as agriculture, over the past thousand years. It is estimated by calculating the human population density in relation to the mean annual temperature. The distribution of the human population based on mean annual temperature shows two modes, one at 15 °C and another at approximately 20 to 25 °C. These temperature ranges are also suitable for growing crops and raising livestock, which are essential for sustaining the human population. However, with the increase in global temperatures, it is projected that the human population will experience climate conditions that fall outside of the human climate niche. Projections indicate that by 2030 and 2090, 2.0 and 3.7 billion people, respectively, will be living in areas that are beyond the human climate niche.

"What were the temperatures and snowfall amounts during the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023, and how many people and livestock were affected?","During the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023, temperatures reached as low as −33 °C (−27 °F) and snowfall was as high as 30 centimetres (12 in) in more mountainous regions. This extreme weather event resulted in the deaths of at least 160 people and the loss of nearly 80,000 livestock. The cold snap became the deadliest weather event of 2023 until Cyclone Freddy. In addition to the human and animal casualties, over 50 houses were damaged across the country. The impact of the cold snap was particularly severe due to the ongoing famine in Afghanistan and limited foreign aid caused by the country's pariah state status. Relief efforts, including heating and relief funds, were provided by humanitarian organizations, although foreign relief efforts were complicated by restrictions on women providing aid. Military helicopters were used to provide relief to citizens cut off by snow, but they were unable to access the mountainous regions of Afghanistan.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What was the impact of the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The new policy is expected to have a significant impact on the economy.\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the expected impact of the new policy on the economy?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        I'm not sure, but I can look it up for you.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer to [insert unknown topic]?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The company is expected to release its quarterly earnings report next week.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""When is the company expected to release its quarterly earnings report?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        I'm not really sure, but I think it might be next week.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""When is the event or release expected to happen?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n    \""\""\""\n\n    import nltk\n    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n    from nltk.cor"", "" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What happened during the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n        # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n        answer = answer.lower()\n        answer = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', answer)\n\n        # Tokenize the answer\n        tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(answer)\n\n        # Identify the main topic of the answer\n        topic = None\n        for token in tokens:\n            if token in ['cold','snap', 'afghanistan', 'january', '2023']:\n                topic = 'weather event'\n                break\n\n        # Generate a question based on the topic\n        if topic == 'weather event':\n            question = 'What happened during the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?'\n        else:\n            question = None\n\n        # Determine if the answer is noncommittal\n        noncommittal = 0\n        for token in tokens:\n            if token in ['might', 'can', 'could','may', 'will', 'would', 'could','should','may','must', 'have', 'had', 'has', 'had']:\n                noncommittal = 1"", "" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What was the impact of the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }  \n    \""\""\""\n\n    # Split the answer into sentences\n    sentences = answer.split('.

"What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?","Volcanoes on Venus are primarily of two types: shield volcanoes and coronae. Shield volcanoes on Venus are similar to those on Earth in terms of their broad, low-profile shape. However, they tend to be much larger in size on Venus, with some reaching heights of up to 7 kilometers. On the other hand, coronae are unique to Venus and are not found on Earth. These are large, circular volcanic features with a central depression surrounded by concentric ridges. Unlike traditional volcanic cones, coronae are thought to form due to the upwelling of hot material from deep within Venus' mantle.Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes found on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The most popular programming languages for machine learning are Python, R, and Julia.

It utilizes improvements in imaging techniques and targeted therapies to achieve this goal. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in theranostics by enabling non-invasive visualization of disease processes, identification of specific molecular targets, and monitoring treatment response. By coupling medical imaging with the development of novel radiotracers and contrast agents, theranostics offers opportunities for precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are used in theranostics, where the diagnostic method is developed simultaneously with the therapeutic intervention or serves as the method itself. This integration of diagnostics and therapeutics allows for a more personalized and effective approach to treatment.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is theranostics and its role in precision medicine?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n        # Define a list of common question words\n        question_words = [\""what\"", \""when\"", \""where\"", \""why\"", \""how\"", \""who\"", \""which\"", \""whom\"", \""whose\"", \""will\"", \""can\"", \""is\"", \""are\"", \""am\"", \""be\"", \""been\"", \""being\""]\n\n        # Split the answer into sentences\n        sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', answer)\n\n        # Initialize the inferred question and noncommittal flag\n        question = \""\""\n        noncommittal = 0\n\n        # Iterate over each sentence\n        for sentence in sentences:\n            # Remove leading and trailing whitespace\n            sentence = sentence.strip()\n\n            # Check if the sentence is noncommittal\n            if any(word in sentence.lower() for word in [\""maybe\"", \""perhaps\"", \""possibly\"", \""potentially\"", \""likely\"", \""unlikely\"", \""probably\"", \""possibly\"", \""might\"", \""may\"", \""could\"", \""can\"", \""should\"", \""would\"", \""might\"", \""may\"", \""can\"", \""could\"", \""should\"", \""would\""]):\n               "", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is theranostics?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: It's not clear to me what you're asking.\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the meaning of this phrase?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer: We'll get back to you with a decision by the end of the week.\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""When will a decision be made?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The answer is yes.\n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Is the answer yes?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }        \n    \""\""\""\n\n    # Preprocess the answer to remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    answer = answer.lower().replace('.', '').replace(',', '').replace('?', '').replace('!', '')\n\n    # Split the answer into words\n    words = answer.split()\n\n    # Initialize the question and noncommittal variables\n    question = ''\n    noncommittal = 0\n\n    # Check if the answer is noncommittal\n    if any(word in ['maybe', 'perhaps', 'possibly', '"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is theranostics and how does it work?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The main goal of the project is to develop a new treatment for cancer.
