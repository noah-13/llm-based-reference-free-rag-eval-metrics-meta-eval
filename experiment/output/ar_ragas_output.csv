"Which countries and international organizations have imposed sanctions against Russia and Crimea, and what were the reasons for these sanctions?","A large number of countries, including the United States, Canada, the European Union, and international organizations, have imposed sanctions against Russia and Crimea. These sanctions were imposed following the Russian annexation of Crimea, which began in late February 2014. The sanctions were imposed against individuals, businesses, and officials from Russia and Ukraine. The United States enacted the Magnitsky Act in 2012 to punish Russian officials responsible for the death of Sergei Magnitsky, and later passed the Global Magnitsky Act to allow sanctions on foreign government officials implicated in human rights abuses. The European Union and other countries also passed similar laws to ban foreigners involved in human rights abuses from entering their countries. The sanctions were aimed at bringing about a change in policy or activity by Russia and Crimea.",,"["" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What were the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        The answer is not known.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        I'm not sure.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        The company has not made an official statement yet.\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the company's official statement?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \""\""\""\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nimport nltk\nnltk.download('wordnet')\nnltk.download('punkt')\nlemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n\ndef generate_question(answer):\n    # Tokenize the answer\n    tokens = word_tokenize(answer)\n    \n    # Lemmatize the tokens\n    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]\n    \n    # Remove stop words\n    stop_words = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The world is a complex and dynamic place.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the nature of the world?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The United States and the European Union have been working together to address the crisis in Ukraine.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is being done to address the crisis in Ukraine?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        There are many ways to achieve success.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""How can one achieve success?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n    \""\""\""\n\nimport nltk\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nimport string\nimport re\n\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\n\nstop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\nlemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n\ndef generate_question(answer):\n    # Tokenize the answer\n"", "" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the sanctions imposed on Russia and Crimea?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        The answer to that is a bit complicated.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer to that?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        I am not sure.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        I am not going to answer that.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Will you answer that?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        I think it is a good idea.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Do you think it is a good idea?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        It is a possibility.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""Is it a possibility?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        I am not aware of any information that would suggest otherwise.  \n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question""]","["""", """", """"]","[1, 1, 1]",0,"[""parse_failed"", ""parse_failed"", ""parse_failed""]",1

"When was the Roanoke and Tar River Railroad fully merged into the Seaboard Air Line Railway network, and what happened to the line after that?","The Roanoke and Tar River Railroad was fully merged into the Seaboard Air Line Railway network in 1911. After the merger, the line operated as the Seaboard Air Line's Lewiston Subdivision. In 1967, the Seaboard Air Line merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad to form the Seaboard Coast Line Railroad. The Lewiston Subdivision connected with an ex-ACL line in Kelford. In 1980, the Seaboard Coast Line's parent company merged with the Chessie System to create the CSX Corporation. The CSX Corporation initially operated the Chessie and Seaboard Systems separately until 1986, when they were merged into CSX Transportation. The southernmost five miles of the line from Kelford to Lewiston was abandoned sometime after 1986. The remaining line from Boykins to Kelford was sold to the North Carolina and Virginia Railroad in 1987, who operates the line today.",,"["" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What happened to the Roanoke and Tar River Railroad?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The company is a major player in the global market and has a strong presence in many countries.

"What is the purpose of the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act, and how does it aim to expand access to methadone for patients with opioid use disorder?",The purpose of the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act is to expand access to methadone for patients with opioid use disorder. It aims to do this by implementing various measures such as removing the requirement for patients to visit a clinic daily for methadone treatment and allowing qualified healthcare providers to prescribe methadone for opioid use disorder treatment in an office-based setting.Methadone is a medication used to treat opioid addiction. It works by reducing withdrawal symptoms and cravings.

"What was the cause of the rebellion staged by the Wagner Group in 2023, and how did it end?","The rebellion staged by the Wagner Group in 2023 was caused by increasing tensions between the Russian Ministry of Defence and the leader of Wagner, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin, who was supportive of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, publicly criticized Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov, blaming them for the country's military shortcomings. He accused them of handing over ""Russian territories"" to Ukraine. Prigozhin portrayed the rebellion as a response to an alleged attack on his forces by the ministry and demanded that Shoigu and Gerasimov be turned over to him. Russian president Vladimir Putin denounced Wagner's actions as treason and pledged to quell the rebellion.

"What caused the crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in Pokhara, Nepal?","The crash of Yeti Airlines Flight 691 in Pokhara, Nepal was caused by a technical issue with the plane. According to a spokesperson from the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, the weather was clear at the time of the crash, and preliminary information suggests that the crash was due to a technical problem. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders were recovered and examined, and a preliminary report indicated that the propellers of the aircraft had been feathered, causing the engines to produce no thrust and leading the plane into a stall. It was also noted that the power levers and condition levers were incorrectly set, possibly due to a mistake during the landing checklist.

What are the main science objectives of the JUICE orbiter and what moons will it study?,"The main science objectives of the JUICE orbiter are to perform detailed investigations on Ganymede, Europa, and Callisto, three of Jupiter's Galilean moons. For Ganymede, the objectives include characterizing the ocean layers and detecting subsurface water reservoirs, mapping the surface topography, geology, and composition, studying the physical properties of the icy crusts, characterizing the internal mass distribution and dynamics of the interior, investigating Ganymede's tenuous atmosphere, and studying its intrinsic magnetic field and its interactions with the Jovian magnetosphere. For Europa, the focus is on studying the chemistry essential to life, including organic molecules, understanding the formation of surface features, and determining the composition of non-water-ice material. The JUICE orbiter will also carry out spatially resolved observations of several minor irregular satellites and the volcanically active moon Io.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the main science objectives of the JUICE orbiter?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The primary goals of the JUICE mission are to explore Jupiter's icy moons and understand their potential for hosting life.

What is the objective of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project and how is it expected to enhance trade and logistics efficiency?,"The objective of the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan Railway Project is to create a direct railway link between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, passing through Afghanistan's territory. This project aims to enhance trade and logistics efficiency by establishing a 573-km rail connection that would connect Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, to Kabul and Peshawar, the capitals of Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively. The implementation of this project is anticipated to strengthen trade relations between Pakistan and South Asia. The trilateral agreement signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Uzbekistan aims to significantly reduce cargo delivery times between Uzbekistan and Pakistan by approximately five days.

What factors contributed to the Sri Lankan economic crisis?,"The Sri Lankan economic crisis was caused by multiple compounding factors. These include tax cuts and money creation by the government, which led to budget deficits and a decline in government revenue. The government's decision to shift to organic or biological farming also played a role. Additionally, the crisis was exacerbated by the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The country's high external debt, with a significant increase in foreign debt in recent years, also contributed to the crisis.

It is a multimodal large language model created by OpenAI and is the fourth model in the GPT series. Some of its capabilities include being able to take images as well as text as input, having context windows of 8,192 and 32,768 tokens, and being able to perform tasks beyond text-prediction such as using APIs, generating images, and accessing and summarizing webpages. GPT-4 also demonstrates aptitude on standardized tests and has been tested in medical applications. However, it has limitations such as hallucinating and lacking transparency in its decision-making processes.",0.0,"["" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is GPT-4?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        } \n\n        Note: This is a more complex example, and the output might not be perfect. The model should be able to identify the main topic of the answer and generate a question based on that.

"What caused the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023, and what were the consequences of the violence?","The ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023 was sparked by tensions between the Meitei people, who reside in the Imphal Valley, and the Kuki tribal community from the surrounding hills. The violence erupted after a High Court ordered that the Meitei community be recommended for Scheduled Tribe status, which caused protests and clashes between the two groups. The violence resulted in the deaths of 142 people, with over 300 wounded and approximately 54,488 people displaced. Houses, places of worship, and other properties were burnt and destroyed during the riots. The violence also deepened existing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities, with inflammatory statements made by political leaders further exacerbating the situation. A panel led by a retired Chief Justice was established to investigate the violence, and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will probe six cases related to conspiracy in the violence.",0.0,"["" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What caused the ethnic violence in Manipur in 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The city is known for its vibrant nightlife, with many bars and clubs located along the famous Bourbon Street.

"What is the current status of the Myanmar civil war, and how many people have been internally displaced since the coup?","The current status of the Myanmar civil war is complex and evolving. Since the military coup in February 2021, there has been widespread unrest and resistance from the civilian population. Armed ethnic groups have also been involved in clashes with the military forces. However, it is challenging to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the situation due to limited access to information and ongoing conflicts.\n\nRegarding the number of internally displaced people since the coup, it is difficult to provide an exact figure. However, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of September 2021, an estimated 230,000 people have been internally displaced in Myanmar since the coup. It is important to note that this number is subject to change as the situation continues to unfold.Myanmar is a country in Southeast Asia with a rich cultural heritage and diverse ethnic groups.

"How many teams participate in the Turkish Women's Football Super League, and what is the format of the league?","In the 2022–23 season, the Turkish Women's Football Super League consists of one group of 10 teams and one group of nine teams. The teams play a double round robin and finals to determine the champion club, which qualifies for the UEFA Women's Champions League. The league format has undergone changes over the years, with different numbers of teams and various rounds of play. In the 2010–11 season, there were twelve teams and a championship and relegation group. In the 2012–13 season, there were ten teams and a double-round robin format. In the 2019-20 season, the league expanded to twelve teams again, and no relegation took place. The 2020-21 season was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and featured 16 teams divided into four groups. Each team played three matches in a round-robin tournament, and the top two teams from each group advanced to the quarter-finals and semi-finals in a single-elimination tournament.

How does the height and thrust of the Starship rocket compare to other rockets?,"The Starship rocket has a height of 120 meters (394 feet), making it the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. It surpasses the thrust of NASA's Space Launch System, Saturn V, and the Soviet N1, which previously held the record. The Starship rocket has a liftoff mass of 5,000 metric tons (11,000,000 pounds) and is powered by Raptor rocket engines, which burn liquid methane and liquid oxygen. It operates in a full-flow staged combustion power cycle. The rocket is designed to be fully reusable, with both the first-stage Super Heavy booster and the second-stage spacecraft, also named Starship, performing controlled landings. The Starship rocket has a payload capacity of 150 tonnes (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in a fully reusable configuration and 250 t (550,000 lb) when expended. It is also designed to enable transit to higher energy destinations such as geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars by refilling with propellant launched in tanker Starships. The Starship rocket represents SpaceX's ambition to become its primary launch vehicle, superseding the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles.

"What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?","On Venus, there are shield volcanoes, pancake dome volcanoes, and scalloped margin domes. Shield volcanoes on Venus can cover hundreds of kilometers in area and have an average height of 1.5 kilometers. They cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward and can produce flexural moats and ring fractures. Pancake dome volcanoes on Venus are up to 15 kilometers in diameter and less than 1 kilometer in height. They are associated with coronae and tesserae and are formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Scalloped margin domes, also known as ""tick-like"" structures, have numerous legs and have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. These types of volcanoes are not present on Earth. On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. Shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii, eject relatively fluid magma from hot spots, while composite volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates and erupt gummier lava.",,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the different types of volcanoes found on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n\n        Answer:\n        The answer to this question is difficult to determine because there are many factors that influence the cost of a house.

The trail served as a crucial trade route during the Abbasid era and was designed to serve pilgrims from Iraq, neighboring Islamic countries, and East Asian countries. It stretches over a distance of 1,300 kilometers and is connected to 27 main stations, with 58 subsidiary stations called Muta'asha established between them.

This proposed legislation would give pharmacies the ability to provide methadone to patients with OUD, and it would also allow approved healthcare providers to prescribe take-home doses for OUD patients.

"Who is buried in the Tomb of Alexander Stewart, and what is the condition of the tomb?","The Tomb of Alexander Stewart, also known as the Tomb of the Wolf of Badenoch, was built for Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, who is buried underneath. The tomb consists of a 15th-century tomb effigy and altar tomb, both carved from marble. The effigy shows Stuart in full knightly armor, with a lion or dog resting at his feet. However, the tomb is in poor condition, having been broken apart and defaced during the Scottish Reformation in the 16th century. The effigy is now in four separate pieces, with the right foot missing and severe damage to the face and left foot.

What is the human climate niche and how is it estimated?,"The human climate niche refers to the range of climate conditions that have supported human life and activities, such as agriculture, over the past thousand years. It is estimated by calculating the human population density in relation to the mean annual temperature. The distribution of the human population based on mean annual temperature shows two modes, one at 15 °C and another at approximately 20 to 25 °C. These temperature ranges are also suitable for growing crops and raising livestock, which are essential for sustaining the human population. However, with the increase in global temperatures, it is projected that the human population will experience climate conditions that fall outside of the human climate niche. Projections indicate that by 2030 and 2090, 2.0 and 3.7 billion people, respectively, will be living in areas that are beyond the human climate niche.

"What were the temperatures and snowfall amounts during the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023, and how many people and livestock were affected?","During the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023, temperatures reached as low as −33 °C (−27 °F) and snowfall was as high as 30 centimetres (12 in) in more mountainous regions. This extreme weather event resulted in the deaths of at least 160 people and the loss of nearly 80,000 livestock. The cold snap became the deadliest weather event of 2023 until Cyclone Freddy. In addition to the human and animal casualties, over 50 houses were damaged across the country. The impact of the cold snap was particularly severe due to the ongoing famine in Afghanistan and limited foreign aid caused by the country's pariah state status. Relief efforts, including heating and relief funds, were provided by humanitarian organizations, although foreign relief efforts were complicated by restrictions on women providing aid. Military helicopters were used to provide relief to citizens cut off by snow, but they were unable to access the mountainous regions of Afghanistan.",0.0,"["" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What happened during the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }    \n    \""\""\""\n    import re\n    from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n    from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n    from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n\n    # Initialize lemmatizer and stop words\n    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\n    # Preprocess the answer\n    answer = re.sub(r'[^\\w\\s]', '', answer).lower()\n    tokens = word_tokenize(answer)\n    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens if token not in stop_words]\n    answer =''.join(tokens)\n\n    # Identify the question\n    if 'what' in answer:\n        question = 'What'+ answer\n    elif 'when' in answer:\n        question = 'When'+ answer\n    elif 'where' in answer:\n        question = 'Where'+ answer\n    elif 'how' in answer:\n        question = 'How'+ answer\n    elif 'why' in answer:\n        question = 'Why'+ answer\n"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What was the impact of the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n    \""\""\""\n\nimport re\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef generate_question(answer):\n    # Tokenize the answer\n    tokens = word_tokenize(answer)\n    # Remove stopwords\n    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n    tokens = [t for t in tokens if t not in stop_words]\n    # Count the frequency of each word\n    word_freq = Counter(tokens)\n    # Find the most common words\n    common_words = [t for t in word_freq if word_freq[t] > 1]\n    # Construct the question\n    question =''.join(common_words)\n    # Check if the answer is noncommittal\n    noncommittal = any(re.search(r'\\b(might|can|could|may|should|will|would|is|are|am|be|been|being|has|had|have|had|has|had|been|being|is|are|am|be|been|being|has|had|have|had|has|"", "" \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What was the impact of the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n\n        # Tokenize the answer\n        tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(answer)\n\n        # Identify the main clause of the answer\n        main_clause = [token for token in tokens if token.isupper()]\n\n        # Identify the key phrases in the main clause\n        key_phrases = [phrase for phrase in nltk.ngrams(main_clause, 3) if phrase[0].isupper()]\n\n        # Identify the question that the answer likely responds to\n        question =''.join(key_phrases[0])\n\n        # Check if the answer is noncommittal\n        noncommittal = 0\n        if'might' in tokens or 'can't' in tokens or 'not' in tokens or 'don't' in tokens or 'unable' in tokens:\n            noncommittal = 1\n\n        # Return the output as a JSON object\n        return {\n            \""question\"": question,\n            \""noncommittal\"": noncommittal\n        }\n    # Test the function\n    answer1 = \""I think it might work, but I can't guarantee it.\""\n   ""]","[""What happened during the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?"", ""What was the impact of the cold snap in Afghanistan in January 2023?"", """"]","[0, 0, 1]",0,"[""ok"", ""ok"", ""parse_failed""]",1

"What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?","Volcanoes on Venus are primarily of two types: shield volcanoes and coronae. Shield volcanoes on Venus are similar to those on Earth in terms of their broad, low-profile shape. However, they tend to be much larger in size on Venus, with some reaching heights of up to 7 kilometers. On the other hand, coronae are unique to Venus and are not found on Earth. These are large, circular volcanic features with a central depression surrounded by concentric ridges. Unlike traditional volcanic cones, coronae are thought to form due to the upwelling of hot material from deep within Venus' mantle.Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n        import re\n        from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\n        from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n        import nltk\n        nltk.download('punkt')\n        nltk.download('wordnet')\n\n        lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n        answer = answer.lower()\n\n        # Tokenize the answer\n        tokens = word_tokenize(answer)\n\n        # Remove stop words and punctuation\n        stop_words = set(nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'))\n        tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens if token.isalpha() and token not in stop_words]\n\n        # Identify the main topic of the answer\n        main_topic = ''\n        for token in tokens:\n            if token not in stop_words:\n                main_topic = token\n                break\n\n        # Generate the question\n        if main_topic:\n            question = f\""What is {main_topic}?\""\n        else:\n            question = ''\n\n        # Classify the answer as noncommittal\n        noncommittal = 0\n        if'might' in tokens or 'can' in tokens"", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        I'm not really sure, I'll have to check on that.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer to this question?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        The Sun is a star at the center of the solar system.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the center of the solar system?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        I'm not really sure, I'll have to check on that.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the answer to this question?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        It is a matter of perspective.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the perspective on this matter?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        The capital of France is Paris.\n\n        Output:\n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the capital of France?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n       "", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes on Venus?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: The company has a strong focus on innovation and is constantly exploring new technologies and ideas.

What is theranostics and how does it combine diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in precision medicine?,"Theranostics, also known as theragnostics, is an emerging field in precision medicine that combines diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to provide the potential for personalized treatment and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of treatments. It utilizes improvements in imaging techniques and targeted therapies to achieve this goal. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in theranostics by enabling non-invasive visualization of disease processes, identification of specific molecular targets, and monitoring treatment response. By coupling medical imaging with the development of novel radiotracers and contrast agents, theranostics offers opportunities for precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are used in theranostics, where the diagnostic method is developed simultaneously with the therapeutic intervention or serves as the method itself. This integration of diagnostics and therapeutics allows for a more personalized and effective approach to treatment.",0.0,"[""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is theranostics and how does it work?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \""\""\""\n\nfrom nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize\nfrom nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport json\n\ndef generate_question_and_classify(answer):\n    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()\n    tokens = word_tokenize(answer.lower())\n    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]\n    counter = Counter(tokens)\n\n    # Generate a question\n    question = ''\n    for token in counter.most_common(10):\n        if token[0] in ['what', 'how', 'when', 'where', 'why', 'which', 'who', 'that', 'these', 'those']:\n            question += token[0] +''\n        if token[0] in ['is', 'are', 'am', 'be', 'been', 'being', 'do', 'does', 'did', 'will', 'would', 'can', 'could','may','might','shall','should','must', 'need', 'ought','shall','should']:\n            question +="", ""  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is theranostics?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 0\n        }\n        \n        Answer: \n        The concept of theranostics is still evolving and there is ongoing research to further develop this field. \n        Output:  \n        {\n        \""question\"": \""What is the current state of theranostics research?\"",\n        \""noncommittal\"": 1\n        }\n        \n        Answer:\n        Theranostics is a multidisciplinary field that combines diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to provide personalized treatment and real-time monitoring of treatment effectiveness.
