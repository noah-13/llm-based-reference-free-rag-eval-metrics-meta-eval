The violence erupted after a High Court ordered that the Meitei community be recommended for Scheduled Tribe status, which caused protests and clashes between the two groups. The violence resulted in the deaths of 142 people, with over 300 wounded and approximately 54,488 people displaced. Houses, places of worship, and other properties were burnt and destroyed during the riots. The violence also deepened existing tensions between the Meitei and Kuki communities, with inflammatory statements made by political leaders further exacerbating the situation.

How does the height and thrust of the Starship rocket compare to other rockets?,"The Starship rocket has a height of 120 meters (394 feet), making it the largest and most powerful rocket ever flown. It surpasses the thrust of NASA's Space Launch System, Saturn V, and the Soviet N1, which previously held the record. The Starship rocket has a liftoff mass of 5,000 metric tons (11,000,000 pounds) and is powered by Raptor rocket engines, which burn liquid methane and liquid oxygen. It operates in a full-flow staged combustion power cycle. The rocket is designed to be fully reusable, with both the first-stage Super Heavy booster and the second-stage spacecraft, also named Starship, performing controlled landings. The Starship rocket has a payload capacity of 150 tonnes (330,000 lb) to low Earth orbit in a fully reusable configuration and 250 t (550,000 lb) when expended. It is also designed to enable transit to higher energy destinations such as geosynchronous orbit, the Moon, and Mars by refilling with propellant launched in tanker Starships. The Starship rocket represents SpaceX's ambition to become its primary launch vehicle, superseding the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles.

"What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?","On Venus, there are shield volcanoes, pancake dome volcanoes, and scalloped margin domes. Shield volcanoes on Venus can cover hundreds of kilometers in area and have an average height of 1.5 kilometers. They cause the Venusian lithosphere to flex downward and can produce flexural moats and ring fractures. Pancake dome volcanoes on Venus are up to 15 kilometers in diameter and less than 1 kilometer in height. They are associated with coronae and tesserae and are formed by highly viscous, silica-rich lava erupting under Venus's high atmospheric pressure. Scalloped margin domes, also known as ""tick-like"" structures, have numerous legs and have undergone mass wasting events such as landslides on their margins. These types of volcanoes are not present on Earth. On Earth, volcanoes are mainly of two types: shield volcanoes and composite or stratovolcanoes. Shield volcanoes, like those in Hawaii, eject relatively fluid magma from hot spots, while composite volcanoes, like Mount St. Helens and Mount Pinatubo, are associated with tectonic plates and erupt gummier lava.",0,0.932574450969696,"[""Here is the output:\n\n{\n  \""question\"": \""What are the types and characteristics of volcanoes on Venus and Earth?\"", \n  \""noncommittal\"": 0\n}\n\nThe answer provides specific and detailed information about the types and characteristics of volcanoes on Venus and Earth, making it a committal answer."", ""Here is the output:\n\n{\n    \""question\"": \""What are the different types of volcanoes found on Venus?\"", \n    \""noncommittal\"": 0\n}\n\nThe answer provides specific and detailed information about the different types of volcanoes found on Venus, including their characteristics, formation processes, and differences from volcanoes"", ""Here is the output:\n\n{\n    \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes found on Venus and Earth?\"", \n    \""noncommittal\"": 0\n}\n\nThe answer provides detailed information about the types of volcanoes found on Venus and Earth, including their characteristics, formation processes, and differences between the two""]","[""What are the types and characteristics of volcanoes on Venus and Earth?"", ""What are the different types of volcanoes found on Venus?"", ""What are the types of volcanoes found on Venus and Earth?""]","[0, 0, 0]",1,"[""ok"", ""ok"", ""ok""]",1

What is the human climate niche and how is it estimated?,"The human climate niche refers to the range of climate conditions that have supported human life and activities, such as agriculture, over the past thousand years. It is estimated by calculating the human population density in relation to the mean annual temperature. The distribution of the human population based on mean annual temperature shows two modes, one at 15 °C and another at approximately 20 to 25 °C. These temperature ranges are also suitable for growing crops and raising livestock, which are essential for sustaining the human population. However, with the increase in global temperatures, it is projected that the human population will experience climate conditions that fall outside of the human climate niche. Projections indicate that by 2030 and 2090, 2.0 and 3.7 billion people, respectively, will be living in areas that are beyond the human climate niche.

"What types of volcanoes are found on Venus, and how do they differ from those on Earth?","Volcanoes on Venus are primarily of two types: shield volcanoes and coronae. Shield volcanoes on Venus are similar to those on Earth in terms of their broad, low-profile shape. However, they tend to be much larger in size on Venus, with some reaching heights of up to 7 kilometers. On the other hand, coronae are unique to Venus and are not found on Earth. These are large, circular volcanic features with a central depression surrounded by concentric ridges. Unlike traditional volcanic cones, coronae are thought to form due to the upwelling of hot material from deep within Venus' mantle.Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",1,0.9731042385101318,"[""Here is the output:\n\n{\n    \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes found on Venus and how do they differ from those on Earth?\"", \n    \""noncommittal\"": 0\n}\n\nThe answer provides specific information about the types of volcanoes found on Venus, their characteristics, and how they differ"", ""Here is the output:\n\n{\n    \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes found on Venus and how do they differ from those on Earth?\"", \n    \""noncommittal\"": 0\n}\n\nThe answer is committal because it provides specific information about the types of volcanoes found on Venus, their characteristics"", ""Here is the output:\n\n{\n    \""question\"": \""What are the types of volcanoes found on Venus?\"", \n    \""noncommittal\"": 0\n}\n\nThe answer provides specific information about the types of volcanoes found on Venus, their characteristics, and how they differ from those on Earth.

What is theranostics and how does it combine diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in precision medicine?,"Theranostics, also known as theragnostics, is an emerging field in precision medicine that combines diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to provide the potential for personalized treatment and real-time monitoring of the effectiveness of treatments. It utilizes improvements in imaging techniques and targeted therapies to achieve this goal. Medical imaging plays a crucial role in theranostics by enabling non-invasive visualization of disease processes, identification of specific molecular targets, and monitoring treatment response. By coupling medical imaging with the development of novel radiotracers and contrast agents, theranostics offers opportunities for precise diagnosis and targeted therapy. Diagnostic-therapeutic approaches are used in theranostics, where the diagnostic method is developed simultaneously with the therapeutic intervention or serves as the method itself. This integration of diagnostics and therapeutics allows for a more personalized and effective approach to treatment.",1,0.9047662615776062,"[""Here is the output:\n\n{\n\""question\"": \""What is theranostics and how does it work?\"", \n\""noncommittal\"": 0\n}\n\nThe answer is not noncommittal because it provides a clear and detailed explanation of what theranostics is, its applications, and its benefits.
